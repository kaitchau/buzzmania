# buzzmania

**Inspiration**
Inspired by the addictive gameplay of Cookie Clicker, Buzzmania puts a buzz-worthy twist on the classic clicker genre. 
We were captivated by the simplicity and engagement of Cookie Clicker's mechanics and sought to bring that same addictive 
experience to a new audience while also raising awareness about the endangerment of bees.

**What it does**
Buzzmania is an addicting clicker game where players take on the role of a busy bee collecting nectar from colorful flowers. 
With each click, players gather nectar, contributing to their hive's growth and prosperity. As players accumulate nectar, 
they can unlock upgrades, power-ups, and bee hats to enhance their buzzing empire.

**How we built it**
Built using React framework, Buzzmania features a responsive and dynamic user interface, allowing for seamless gameplay across 
various devices and screen sizes. We utilized React's component-based architecture to implement clicker mechanics, state management, 
and interactive elements. CSS styling and animations were applied to create visually appealing flower fields and bee characters.
